### Generic Print

----

* Implemented Interfaces: ``IResponseHandler``

As the name suggests, the *GenericPrint* plugin attempts to print the servers *RMI response* in some
kind of way. It uses some reasonable default print functions for arrays and collections and also supports
pretty printing for some more complex types.
