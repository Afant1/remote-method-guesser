### Known Endpoints

---

*remote-method-guesser* helps you to identify which classes are sitting behind bound names within an *RMI registry*.
This can be useful, as you may find the corresponding class definitions online or at least can figure out in which
kind of project they are used. Since *rmg v4.0.0* we attempt to provide even more useful information, by tracking
known remote objects within this repository. The list of known remote objects is currently rather small, but will
hopefully extended in future.
